# LRU

## Implement Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

### You need to implement the following for the LRUCache class:


- `LRUCache(int capacity)` initializes the cache to store data of size: capacity.
- `int get(int key)` returns the value of the key if it exists, otherwise returns -1.
- `void add(int key, int value)` updates the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity
from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

#### Note: Try to achieve each operation in O(1) time complexity.
